Crypto Chart Generator - CreateChart-In-Binance :
Crypto Chart Generator is a simple PHP-based tool that allows you to fetch real-time candlestick data from the Binance API and visualize it through a generated chart. This project makes it easy for users to monitor cryptocurrency price fluctuations in a visually appealing way.

Features :
Fetches candlestick data from the Binance API for a given cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC/USDT).
Generates and displays candlestick charts.
Supports different time intervals (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
Simple and easy-to-use code for developers to integrate into their applications.
Technologies Used :
PHP: The main backend language for fetching data and generating the chart.
Binance API: For retrieving real-time candlestick data.
GD Library: For generating images of the candlestick charts.
JSON: For data handling between the Binance API and the PHP script.

How It Works:
The user defines the symbol of the cryptocurrency (e.g., BTCUSDT).
The script fetches candlestick data from the Binance API for the specified symbol and interval.
The data is parsed and processed to create a visual candlestick chart.
The generated chart is saved as a PNG image.

Requirements :
To run this project, ensure you have the following:

PHP 7.4 or higher.
GD Library enabled in PHP (required for image creation).
An internet connection to fetch data from the Binance API.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DevMrErfan/CreateChart-In-Binance.git
cd CreateChart-In-Binance
Set up the files: Ensure the src/ folder contains the following PHP files:

Candeldata.php: Fetches the candlestick data from Binance.
createChart.php: Generates the chart image based on the data.
Run the script: After setting up, you can run the index.php file to fetch the data and generate the chart:

php index.php
View the chart: The generated chart image will be saved as chart.png in the project folder. You can open this file to view the generated candlestick chart.

You can customize the following settings:

Symbol: Change the symbol in index.php to track different cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETHUSDT for Ethereum).
Timeframe: Adjust the timeframe in index.php to get different time intervals (e.g., 5m for 5-minute intervals or 1d for daily candlesticks).
